# MiniHttp

This is a very minimalistic HTTP server meant for developers. It is written purely in C# and relies on the [HttpListener](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.httplistener.aspx) class for its core functionality. The architecture of the server is very simple and designed to be as extendible as possible. You should head over to the [Wiki](https://github.com/lord-executor/MiniHttp/wiki) to get an overview of the server's features and you'll find all the developer documentation there as well. (work in progress).

## Binaries

If you're only interested in the compiled binaries, you can find download links on the [Wiki Home Page](https://github.com/lord-executor/MiniHttp/wiki#downloads)
