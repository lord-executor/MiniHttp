TODO:
- move default processors to a separate handler that reacts to specific URLs only (e.g. *.html.processed)
- @url(...) replacement in template processor (make URL absolute to current webroot)
- request/response abstraction
- documentation (wiki pages)
  - user how-to (minimalistic and general purpose server)
  - general architecture
  - request handlers
  - processors
    - template processor
	- variable processor
- configuration of the server through a file in the webroot where it is started
- handler for directory listing (in absence of index file)
- simple virtulaizing handler for use with e.g. markdown to load a template with parameters depending on the virtual resource
- dynamic plugin loading
- Mono support
- unit tests
- code comments

DONE:
- fixing line source enumerator for recursive templates
- return plain text exception information for failed requests
- request preprocessor for .../ -> .../index.{something}
- build script for different deployment artifacts:
  - minimalistic static-files-only server
  - standard server with general purpose configuration
  - library (.dll)
  - automatic update of assembly info
- refactoring of line source into interface + extension method(s)
