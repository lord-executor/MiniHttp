@template("template.html")
<div class="content">
	<h1>This is Content</h1>
	<p>Content text which is quite boring. But now we're including some exciting blocks!</p>
	@import("block.html")
	<p>And now we're going to include the same block but wrapped in another template</p>
	@import("wrappedblock.html")
	<p>To make it even more interesting we're now importing a block with a template that has another template</p>
	@import("doublewrappedblock.html")
	<p>And this is the end of the content</p>
</div>
