<div class="content">
	<h1>This is Content</h1>
	<p>Content text which is quite boring. But now we're including some exciting blocks!</p>
	@import(block.html)
	<p>And now we're going to include the same block but wrapped in another template</p>
	@import(wrappedblock.html)
	<p>And this is the end of the content</p>
